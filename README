* UUID - Unique Universal IDentifier


Services in General
===================

These are all from the application root. For example if the wknyc application
is running under the wknyc context (http://example.com/wknyc) then the full
URL of a reference to /example/list would be http://example.com/wknyc/example/list

Template locations are not finalized but service locations should be. In either
case I'll do my best to keep this document up to date.

--------

To register a basic user (essentially just credentials, no other information)
